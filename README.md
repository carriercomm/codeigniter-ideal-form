I am a firm believer of social coding, so <strike>if</strike> when you find a bug, please fork my code on [GitHub](http://github.com/joelcox/codeigniter-ideal-form) and squash it. I will be happy to merge it back in to the code base (and add you to the "Thanks to" section). If you're not too comfortable using Git or messing with the inner workings of this library, please [open a new issue](http://github.com/joelcox/codeigniter-ideal-form/issues).
